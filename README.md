# Commandline Checkbook Application

I created a command line checkbook application with Python that allows users to track their finances with a command line interface.

When run, the application should welcome the user, and prompt them for an action to take:
- view current balance
- add a debit (withdrawal)
- add a credit (deposit)
- exit

This was done by creating several functions, and then calling a function when a certain option is chosen.
